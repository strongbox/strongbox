# Code Style

While we appreciate all the help we can get, here are some more details on the [coding convention](https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox/wiki/Coding-Convention). Please, follow these guidelines and set up your IDE to use the respective code style configuration file.

# Code of Conduct

If would like to contribute to our project and contribute to our work, please follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

# Pull Requests

Please, follow these basic rules when creating pull requests. Pull requests:
* Should:
  * Be tidy
  * Easy to read
  * Have optimized imports
  * Contain a sufficient amount of comments, if this is a new feature
  * Where applicable, contain a reasonable, (even, if it's just a minimalistic), set of test cases, that cover the bases
* Should not:
  * Change the existing formatting of code, unless this is really required, especially of files that have no other changes, or are not related to the pull request at all. (Please, don't enable pre-commit features in IDE-s such as "Reformat code", "Re-arrange code" and so on, as this may add extra noise to the pull and make the diff harder to read. When adding, or changing code, apply the re-formatting, only to the respective changed code blocks).
  * Have unresolved merge conflicts with the base branch
  * Have failing tests
  * Contain unaddressed **critical** issues reported by Sonar
  * Have commented out dead code. (Commented out code is fine, just not blocks and blocks of it).
  * Contain `public static void(String[] args])` methods (as those would clearly have been used for the sake of quick testing without an actual test case)

Once you've created a new pull request, kindly first review the diff thoroughly yourselves, before requesting it to be reviewed by others and merged.
