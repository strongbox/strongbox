Code of Conduct
===============

Team conduct
------------
* Be respectful
* Keep a friendly tone
* Be open to constructive criticism (we will be doing code reviews of every pull request)

Work conduct
------------
* Before starting work on an issue from the issue tracker, please, make sure there are no active pull requests referencing it.
* When you start working on an issue from issue tracker, please place a comment that you intend do so.
* Timebox your expectations for this work and update the issue/pull request regularly, so that if you say it will take you 2 days and in two weeks there hasn't been apparent progress, if another developer decides they would like to work on this, they can pick it up
* Be professional
* Review your own work after creating a pull and try to resolve any:
  * Build failures
  * Code issues reported by Sonar (unless these are false-positives)
  * Code indentation issues
  * Other issues you spot with your code
